**Custom Nginx Configuration (`nginx.conf`):**
Create this file in the *same directory* as your `Dockerfile` and `index.html`. This configuration is essential for single-page applications (SPAs) like React, ensuring that all routes are handled by `index.html`.

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
    }

    # Optional: Serve specific files directly if needed
    # location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico)$ {
    #     expires max;
    #     log_not_found off;
    # }
}
